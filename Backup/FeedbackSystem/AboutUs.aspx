        <h2>Feedback<span>System</span></h2>
        <div class="img-box"><img src="images/2page-img4.jpg"/><span class="txt1">FEEDBACK</span>  occurs when outputs of a system are routed back as inputs as part of a chain of cause-and-effect that forms a circuit or loop. The system can then be said to feed back into itself. The notion of cause-and-effect has to be handled carefully when applied to feedback systems </div>
        <p class="p0"><span class="txt1"></span> "Simple causal reasoning about a feedback system is difficult because the first system influences the second and second system influences the first, leading to a circular argument. This makes reasoning based upon cause and effect tricky, and it is necessary to analyze the system as a whole.".</p>
